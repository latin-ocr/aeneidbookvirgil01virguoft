iv PREFACE.

in the mistake of confounding interest in the story of the
Aeneid (desirable as that is) with the enjoyment of Virgil's
poetry‚ or rhetorical analysis with appreciation of poetic
beauty.

Besides the colored illustrations after Pinelli's designs re-
peated from previous editions of Books II. and 111„ this book
contains ‘a number of reproductions in hals-tone of antique
statuary and modern painffings, that should aid materially
in giving vividness and clearness to the pupil's conceptionS‚
and heighten his interest in his work. To the same end
many of the notes are accompanied by cuts.

The editor, in sending out what at present he expects to
be the last of the school editions prepared by him, desires to
express his appreciation of the indulgence and favor with
which his fellow-teachers have received his efforts, of the
help and advice he has received from various friends, in
particular from his former collaborator, Mr. A. Carruthers‚
M.A.‚ and of the courtesy of the publisher, who has always
been ready to further every suggestion for making these
editions of Caesar and Virgil as helpful as possible
