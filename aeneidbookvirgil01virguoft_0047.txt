RHYTHM.

Virgss uses in the Aeneid the metre known as Dactylic
Hexameter‚ that is a 11110 containing six dactyls, each dactyl
consisting of one long syllable followed by two short syllables
Two irregularities however are to be noticed3 first, the last
foot has but two syllables (a long and a short, or two long) 3
secondly‚ in any one, two, three or even four of the first 10111Ί
syllables a dactyl may be replaced by a spondee‚ that is a foot
consisting of two long syllables.

This metre is generally represented thus

—vv —vv

 

Thus sixteen different arrangements of the line are possible
(apart from the variation in the last soot), viz. one with the
first four feet dactyls‚ four with one spondee in the line, six
with two spondees in the line, four with three spondees in the
line, and one with four spondees in the first four feet. For
examples 500 the lines indicated on page xxix.

ELISION.

But in a majority of the lines a further difficulty ariseS.
Where the last syllable of a word ends in a vowel, or 111 m,
and the first syllable of the next word begins with a vowel or
h, these two syllables are elided or taken together and counted

as one. Such a case is called 01151011* For example vera
⁶ inquit, counts as three syllables in scansion, so also tegerem
ut, clivum humo, curru haeret.

SCANSION.

Probably the best way for beginners to get the scansion ot'
Virgil is as follows: Mark first all cases of elisi0n3 then the
two last feet, which uniformly consist of the last five syllables,

ἤ Elision is usually marked thus .· vp‘·fa ) inquit or veraffiiozquit.
