prominent in legend, or else representative of some nation3
the interweaving of the old and ever new themes of war and
sea-adventures, with the passion of love.

Virgil's restoration of the legendary past is not exact in all
its details, or sometimes even in its spirit. There is a mixture
of primitive simplieity and luxurious pomp, of the fiereeness
and roughness of an uneultured age and the courtesy, dignity
and kindliness of more polished times. The most unreal of all
his portrayals are the battle soenes of the later books, where
the real interest lies generally, not in the stin-ing events of the
oomhata, but in the pathetie death of some interesting character.

But it objection is taken to Virgil's character-drawing, the
highest praise has always been given to the artistic excellence
of his work, both in its arrangement and in the working out
of details. Virgil (as Tennyson has it) ‘could write ten
lines, they say, at dawn, and lavish all the golden day to
make them wealthier in his reader's eyes.' No poet surpasses
him in finished execution, in stateliness and majesty of move-
ment. His poetry shows a varied and continuous harmony, a
rich, chastened and noble style nowhere else to be found in
Latin.

Sellar regards Virgil as supreme among his countrymen in
‘that subtle fusion of the musio and the meaning of language
which teuc-hes the deepest and most secret springs of emotion.
He touehes especially the emotions of reverenee and of a
yearning for a higher spiritual life, and the sense of noblenaes
in human affairs, in great institutions and great natures; the
sense of the sanetity of human affectionS, of the imaginative
spell exereised by the past, ot the mystery of the unseen world. '

MaeKail speaks of ‘the majestie sadness, the serene and
harmonious cadenees, of poetry enriehed with all the associa-
tions of art and learning, and wrought by patient labor into
the most exquisite finish. But what Virgil has in a degree that
no other poet has ever equalled is pity 3 the sense of “ tears in
