:30 vute-11„ AENEID 1.

Trans. the whole sreely then, 0111101 (l) ‘ sor what thwart-
ing of hm* (livine will or from what resontmcnt,’ or (2) ‘ sor
what insult to her godhead or from what resentment.’

(letum—cs. on superum, 1. 4. regina (leum9—is Juno, the
wife of Jupiter. Volvere‚—‘ to pass through,' as is there were
a very round (or cycle) of mishaps. Like adire, it depends
011 impulerit ‚· the infin. is used more freely in poetry than
in prose, in which we should here have'had ut and subj.
(RC.101.a.iii. H.535.1V. AG.331.9.).

10. pietatQ—is neither piety nor pity quite, but faithful
observance os duty whether to gods, parents, fellow-men‚ 01·
country. Trans. ‘good11ess.' Aeneas is constantly called
pius by Virgil, partly from his filiai devotion to his father,
partly from his dutiful obedience to the voice of the gods
and to the leading of fate. That so ‘good' a man should be
visited by the displeasure of the queen of heaven needs
explanation. For the case see RC.85.‹l. H.424. AG.253.

11. iniplllerit9—subj. in an interrog. clause dependent on
causas memora. (RC.99.aeI. HF.176.‘2. H.529.1. AG.334.)

tantaene‚-s0r ne ef. on ve, l. 9. animis,—the dative,
depending on sunt which is to he understood. As in prese
esse is frequently omitted, especially in the compound tenses
of the verbs, so the poets omit est and sum also. For the dat.
with esse-z‘ belong' see RC.82.9. HF.120.3. H.387. AG.231.

irae‚——Lati11 osten, especially in poetry, uses the plural
where English could use only the singular. (RC.54.e. and fn.
H.130.2.3.) The plur. of abstract nouus often,·as here, indi-

cates either the intensity or various manifestations of a ¹

feeling. For the thought cf. Milton, ‘In heavenly hearts
could such perverseness dwell ἱ) ’

12. :flitmum—from the poet’s point of view, as it was just
building at the time of Aeneas’ visit, 1. 423. Tyrii. .coloni‚

—parentheti03 trans. by relative clause. tenuerQ-the '

ending ere for erunt is very common in poetry‚ being con· s
venient for metrical piu-poses.
