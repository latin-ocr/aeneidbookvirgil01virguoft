his mercy. Turnus begs for quarter, and Aeneas is about, to
grant it, when he catohes sight of the spoils of his young
friend Pallas, and in wrath plunges his sword in Turnus'
heart.

So ends Virgil's story. Aeneas after the war married Lavi-
nia, and from them was sprung the line of kings who reigned
in Alba Longa, as well as Romulus the founder of Rome.

111. —LIFE OF VIRGIL

Publius Vergilius* Maro was born Ro. 70 at the little vil-
lage of Andes near Mantua, in the great northern plain of
Italy, watered by the river Padus, the modern Po. The people
ot this country were of Gallio deseent and not close kinsmen ot
the Romans or southern Italians‚ and it was not till Virgil
was twenty-one years of age that they were made full Roman
citizens, Virgil's father lived on a small farm, but was able
to give his son all the advantages of edueation to be obtained
in those days, perhaps seeing early in his boy some signs os
future greatness. Except that Virgil studied in Cremona and
Milan and at sixteen was sent to Rome to the best teaohers .
there, we know praetioally nothing of his youth. This period
fell between the two great civil wars of Rome, and from what
we know of Virgil's nature, the comparative peace of his boy-
hood and youth was more oongenial than the civil wars that
raged from his twenty-second to his sortieth year.
