228. ῐι·18ῒίοι·,-”ι sadder than her wont.' Venus was often
called ‘the laughter-loving.’ oculos suffusa,—‘ (with) her
eyes filled.' Virgil often uses the perfect partic. pass. with
an accus. in a peculiar way suggested by the Greek middle or
passive participles; e.g. oculos suffusa=‘ having the eyes
filla& nodo sinus collecta, 1. 320, =² haviny the folds yathered
in a knot.’ In many such cases the participle could not be
applied in its strict passive force to the word it agrees with
so well as to the word in the accus.; when this is so, the
usual way of explaining the construction as accus. of speci-
fication (or of the part affected) is rather awkward‚ e.g. in
1. 320. (RC.83.e.ii. HF.98.3. H.377.378. AG.240.c.)
