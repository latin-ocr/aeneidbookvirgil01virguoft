GENERAL PLAN.

The attractive appearance of the book With its clear type,
good paper and fine maps and illustrations prepares one for an
exceptionally well-edited book, and he will not be disappointed.

The editor's books are nothing if not practical. He tries
to keep before his mind at all times the peculiar needs‚ the
limited equipment and the mental attitude of the average
student, and throughout, in notes, introduction, and exereises
Writes‘for the student of Latin as he actually exists to-day
in every High Sehool in OntariO. There are few Canadian
classica] text-books of which it ean be said with equa] truth
that they do not oontain a line that every student who is to
use the book cannot understand and assimilate to his profit.

Two main purposes run through every portion of this
edition: the intelligent translation of Caesar's story into
idiomatio English, and a gradual development of the power
to use the Latin language.
