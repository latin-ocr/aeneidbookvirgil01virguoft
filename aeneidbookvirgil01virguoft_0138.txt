Α cave confines, where, stretching forth merjam,

She drags in hapleSS vessels on the rocks:

Her upper part is human 3 to the waist

A virgin’s beauteous bosom is displayed3

A huge sea-monster in her lower parts,

To a wolf’s womb uniting dolphin tails.

Better Trinacriam Pachynum’s goal

To traverse hasting, and in circuit long

To bend your course, than once to have beheld

Misshapen Scylla ’neath her eavern hugo,

And rocks rebellowing with her seagreen dogs.’'
