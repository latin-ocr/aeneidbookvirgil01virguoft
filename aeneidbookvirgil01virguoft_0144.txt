that Aeneas was still in camp. Rutuli89—not abl. absol.
but dat. like jactanti, l. 102. Trans. ‘had passed over the
R.' subact189—fron1 subigo.

2⁴37. Iu109-—as usual⁷ the name is attracted into the case
of the possessor. (Rustica H.387.N.1. AG.231.b.) It was

addressed by Jupiter to Venus. stetit reg110‚-‘ stood firm

here of course it is peculiarly appropriate to the she-wolf’s
foster-child.

ceed to.’ Mavortia9—with a double reference to the descent
of Romulus from Mars and the warlike character of the
