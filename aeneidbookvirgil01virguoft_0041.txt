INTRODUCTION. xix

XVhen in Β. Ο. 41 peace for a time did come, the victorious
>ctavian confiscated large tracts of land in Italy and distri-
outed them among his soldiers. Virgil's farm (his father being
now dead) was thus seized on, but Virgil had become favorably
known to Asinius Pollio, the governor of the district, and at
his suggestion Virgil went to Rome and appealed to Augustus,
Restitution was made by order of Augustus, though Virgil did
not regain his farm, and soon we find Virgil living at Rome
under the patronage of the court, and on terms of intimacy
with the leading writers of the day. His first volume of
poetry, the Eclogues, a collection of ten pastoral poems, com-
menced before he came to Rome, was completed in B. O. 37, and
soon after he left Rome and for most of his remaining years
lived in Campania near Naples. From Rc. 37 to 30 he worked
at his second great poem, the Georgics‚ a series of four poems
on husbandry as one of the glories of Italian life. The
remaining eleven years of his life were devoted to his great epic
poem, the Aeneid. We are told that in B. C. 23 he read Books
II.‚ IV. and VI. to Augustus at the latter's request. In BG.
19 the poet had completed his epic‚ but intended to devote
three years more to polishing and revising it However,
while on a voyage to Greece and Asia that year, 110 fell
sick at Athens and returned, dying just as he reached
Italy.

In his last illness‚ dissatisfied with the condition of the
Aeneid, he asked his executore to burn it, but fortunately
Augustus forbade their carrying out Virgil's last wish.

In person Virgil is said 10 have been tall and dark, of rustic
even awkward appearance. He was gentle, shy and reserved
in manner, and the purity of his 11Εο gained him the name of
Parthenias, ‘the maiden. ’ No authentic picture exists.

The tomb in which Virgil was buried near Naples long
remained an object of veneration‚ and Virgil himself in the
middle ages came to be looked upon as a sage, magician and
prophet.
