IN a school edition of Virgil such as this, little claim can
be laid to originality of matter in the notes or introduct-ion.

of editions of Virgil is the belief that in the arrangement or
presentation of matter the needs of a particular class of
students can be more fully met than they are by any other
edition equally within their reach. Hence, at* every point,
in both notes and introduction, the needs and the capacities
of those pupils of our High Schools who, having read two
or three books of Caesar, are beginning the study of Latin

this end), indirectly an interest in the poetry itself and a
certain feeling for its beauty will be fostered in the minds
