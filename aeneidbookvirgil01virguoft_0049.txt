INTRODUCTION. xxvii

SPECIAL FEATURES AND IRREGULARITIES.

Another beauty 01 this met-re is the possibilities it affords 01
imitat-‚ive harmony; excsted, or rapid action being often
expressed in a line where dactyls abound, and solemn or
gloomy ideas, stately and majestic movements, and slow or
difficult actions brought out by a line abounding in spondees.
It should be noticed however that the Latin language is
naturally more spondaic than dactylic in its ordinary move-
ment (stately and sonorous rather than lively), and a succes-
sion 01 spondees does not seem to be always expressive 01
something solemn or stately.

The recurrence of certain sounds, e. 9. s and r, seems 011011
intentional. Alliteration is also a very frequent device 01
Virgil's.*

The following irregularities occur:

1. Many of Virgil's lines are unfinished, though conforming
50131· as they go to the regular metre. While in some cases
these 11311 111105 may be intentional or very expressive 01 001·-
tain pathetic emotions, it is probable that Virgil in his final
revision would 11310 altered them. As it is his finer taste pre-
ferred an incomplete line to one padded out with weak additions.

2. In a few cases a superfluous syllable (generally que.) is
found at the end 01 a line, regularly where there could be an
elision with the first word 01 the next line. Such a case is
called H y permeter or Synapheia.

3. In certain lines, where an 01151011 might occur, it does
not. This is most frequently the case where there is a decided

the first and last words of the line ; (b) a double alliteration of two pairs
of words, either alternately or successively or inclusis-ely (τῖε. b cl b (Z or
b b d dor b cl d b) ς (0) of words syntactically related or closely connected
ln thought ς (d) in the two las‘t words of the line.
