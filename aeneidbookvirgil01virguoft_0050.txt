xxviii INTRODUCTION.

pause in the sense. or with Greek proper names. Such ar.
omission of elision is called Hiatus.

4. Occasionally i before a vowel is given the sound of the
semi-vowel gy,- e. 9. abiete pronouneed abyete, three syllables
instead of four. In such cases the 2] sound eounts as a conso-
nant in making position. Other words are oecasionally
shortened‚ e. ῃ. deimle (trisyllable) treated as if ei were a diph-
thong. This shortening is called Synaeresis or Synizesis.

5. Rarely the number of syllables in a word is increased
by breaking up a diphthong. This is called Diaeresis.

6. Syllables regularly long are sometimes shortened, chiefly
in the ending erunt of the perfect indie. active, and in the
ending ius of the gen. sing. This is called Systole. It willbe
remembered that before combinations of a mute and a liquid
(ay. br, tr, cl) syllables often vary in quantity. This same
variation occurs in other cases also in proper names.

7. A final syllable regularly short is sometimes lengthened.
This lengthening (which is called Diastole) occurs only in the
first syllable of a foot and generally at the eaesural pause.
In almost every case the syllable was originally long.

8. It is the exception for a line to end in a monosyllable. .

This occurs generally where Virgil is imitating some earlier

ο Latin poet, or where the sense corresponds to the abrupt

ending.

9. Sometimes the fifth foot is a spondee, chiefly for the
expression of some slow measured movement, or impressive
aet, or in Greek proper names. VVhere this occurs we have a
Spondaic line.
