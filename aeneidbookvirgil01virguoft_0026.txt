In a vision Hector appears to Aeneas, tells h1m that Troy
is lost, bids him fiee and entrusts the gods ot Troy to his care.
Aeneas awaking finds t-he city in flames and rushes forth,
J'oined by other TrojanS‚ to oppose the Greeks. But his efforts
are in vain, his followers are killed and Aeneas sees king Priam
slain and his palace and the whole citadel in possession of the
foe.

His goddess mother now appears and bids him rescue his
own family. His father Anchises is at first unwilling to fiee,
but is overcome by omens that betoken divine guidance and
protection. Aeneas sets out bearing his aged father and the
gods of Troy and leading his little son by the hand. His
wife Creusa follows but in the confusion is lost. When they
have reached a place of safety outside the city walls, Aeneas
discovering her loss returns to the city in search of her. He
finds the Greeks everywhere victorious, but there is no trace
, of Creusa. Suddenly her shade appears to him, to tell him
that she has been saved from captivity by death. She bids
him escape, and he returns to his friends, whom he finds joined
by many more Trojans. With these at dawn he makes his
way to the mountains near Troy.

BOOK III. -The Trojan fugitives build a fleet and cross over
to Thrace where they proceed to found a city. But as Aeneas
is gathering boughs for a sacrifice, drops of blood trickle from
them and a voice tells him he is by the grave of Polydorus, a.
son of Priam, who had been sent with much treasure for safety
to the Thracians, and had been murdered by them.

Leaving this polluted spot they sail to Delos where the
oracle bids them seek their ancient mother—city. Anchises
says this is Crete, from which their ancestor Teucer had come,
and to Crete they steer. But s⁶carcely have they begun to build
a city, when a pestilence breaks out. In a vision the gods of
his ancestors appear to Aeneas, and tell him that it is
another land in the west, called Italy, which he must seek,
