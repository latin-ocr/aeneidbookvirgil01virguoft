V.—THE METRE OF THE AENEID.

The principle upon which rhythm is based in English poetry
is a regular succession of accentcd and unaccented syllables.
In Latin, accent has nothing to do with scansion, which
depends rather 011 the regular succession of long and short
syllables-

LONG AND SHORT SYLLABLES.

A long syllable is one containing a long vowel, or a diph-
thongjss or even a short vowel before two consonants‚ or j, x, or
z,- e. ῃ. the first syllable in each of the following 'words is
long: primus, aedes, mentis, major, temo, [saza. Even if. one
of the two consonants be at the beginning of another word
this rule holds, ay. the syllable sub is short in sub ipsa, but
long in sub montem. But the rule does not always hold when
the two consonants are l or r preceded by some other letter;
e. y. the first syllable of patris may be short or long.

A short syllable is one containing a short vowel (except in
the cases mentioned in th: preceding paragraph), including
regularly all cases where a vowel is followed by another vowel
or diphthong, e. 9. the first syllable in tenet, deus, deae, is
short. But genitivos in ius have i sometimes short sometimes
long, and many proper names, borrowcd from the Greek (in
which this mle does not hold) have a long vowel before another
vowel or diphthong, e. 9. the second syllable of Aeneas, Orion.

In scansion h 13 not considered, so that the first syllable of
adhuc is not long, while in mihi the first syllable 13 short as
certainly as if it were spelled mii.

Syllables then may be short or long either by nature or by
position.

’θ The only diphthongs in Latin arc ae, (ιιι, eu, ei, oe and ui, the two
first being far the communest.
