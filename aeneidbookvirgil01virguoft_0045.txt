INTRODUCTION. xxiii

(Aen. I. 462) he has given ilnperishable expression, and which
fills with strange insight and profound emotion those lonely
words and pathetio half lines where he has sounded the depths
01 beauty and sorrow, 01 patience and magnanimity, 01 honor
in 1110 and hope beyond death.’

Perhaps nothing so completely expresses the modern view
of Virgil as the lines of Tennyson (himself the most Virgilian
01 all our modern poets), written 31, 1110 request of 1110 people

of Mantua for the nineteenth oentenary 01 Virgil's death,
1881.

Roman Virgil, thou that singest Ilion’s lofty temples robed 111 fire,

Iliun falling, Rome alising, wars, and filial 131111, and Dido’s pyro 3

Landseape-lover, lord of language more than he that sang the XVorks
and Days,

All the 01105011 00111 01 fancy flashing out from many a ξ(10111011 phrase 3

Thou that singest wheat and woodland, tiltl] and Vineyard‚ hive and
horse and herd 3

All the 01131111 01 311 1110 Muses often flowering 111 3 lonely word 3

Poet 01 the happy Tityrus piping underneath his beechen 11011015 3

Poet 01 1110 poet-satyr whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers 3

ebant-er of the Pollio, glorying in the blissful years again to be,

Summers of the snakeless meadow, unlaborious earth and 0311055 503 3

Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind 3

Thou majestie in thy sadness at the doubtful doom 01 human kind 3

Light among the vanished ages 3 star that gildest yet this phantom
shore. 3

Golden braneh amid the shadoxvs‚ kings and realms 11131 pass to rise no
more 3

Now thy Forum roars no longer 3 fallen every purple Caesar⁷s dome—

Τ11ο1 1111110 ocean-roll of rhythm sound for ever 01 Imperial Rome—

Now the Rome of slaves hath perish’d, and the Rome 0111003103 holds
her place 3

I, from out the Northern Island, sunder⁷d once from all the human 1300,

I salute thee, Mamm-auo, I that loved thee since my day began,

W⁷ielder of the stateliest measure ever moulded hy the lips of man.
